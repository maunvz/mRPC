# Samples
For now this directory contains:
- ```proto```: contains shared protobuf definitions, to be used by all samples
- ```node-cli```: A sample client/server pair written in typescript, which run in a nodejs runtime.

Future samples will be added here and demonstrate interaction among different runtimes/languages.
